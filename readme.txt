Alex (ab15236) and I (np15685) have been asked by a local artist to create a website to
showcase her artwork. We have been given drawings and briefs on the design that she
would like and we hope at the end of the project to host the website for here. At times we
have implemented features to only go back to the drawing board after showing these
features to the client.

Please can you mark for feedback. We expect to add further client side features therefore a
final client side submission on May the 22nd after feedback would be appreciated.
