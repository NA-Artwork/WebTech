<h1>XHTML Test Page</h1>

<p>This page <strong>should</strong> cause an error to be displayed above.  If
there is no error above, or if you can see a second section (with heading
"Second Section") below, then something is wrong.  Either the page is not being
delivered as XHTML, or your browser is not following the XHTML standard.</p>

<p>You can use this page to test your own development setup.  Copy this page
and put it where you are planning to test pages.  Then view it with the browser
you are planning to use for development.  If you can see the second section,
you need to think again.</p>

<h2>Second section</h2>

<p>This is the second section of the test page.  If you can see this, something
is wrong!  Either the place you have put the page is not delivering it as
XHTML, or your browser does not support the XHTML standard correctly.</p>

<p>The paragraph just before this section has two end-paragraph tags,
which is illegal in XHTML, and it is illegal for an XHTML browser to display
any of this page beyond that point.</p>
